Known Bugs and Missing Features in TDBread
==========================================

Optimizer (libgibbs)
--------------------
Pre-calculation of the Hessian abstract syntax trees takes longer than it should.
Phases with miscibility gaps are not correctly handled.
Atomic ordering is not handled.
Ternary interaction parameters for excess models are not handled.
Charged species in sublattices are not correctly handled.
Calculating a single-component, single-phase Equilibrium will show zero for the value of the Gibbs energy (the site/phase fractions will be correct).

TDB Reading (libtdb)
--------------------
References are not recorded.

Python API (pylibgibbs)
-----------------------
Cannot change reference state from the default.
No API yet for manipulating the Equilibrium object once created.
No display of activities / potentials on the user-side.
