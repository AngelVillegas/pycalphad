pycalphad, a library for the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams
==========================================================

Note: Unsolicited pull requests are _happily_ accepted!

pycalphad is a free and open-source Python library for 
designing thermodynamic models, calculating phase diagrams and 
investigating phase equilibria within the CALPHAD method. It 
provides routines for reading Thermo-Calc TDB files and for
solving the multi-component, multi-phase Gibbs energy
minimization problem.

The purpose of this project is to provide any interested people
the ability to tinker with and improve the nuts and bolts of 
CALPHAD modeling without having to be a computer scientist or 
expert programmer.
