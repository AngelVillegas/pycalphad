TDBread Thermodynamic Suite
=============================

TDBread is a free and open-source suite of software tools for designing thermodynamic models, calculating phase diagrams and investigating phase equilibria within the CALPHAD method. It provides interfaces in C++ and Python to libTDB, a library for reading Thermo-Calc TDB files, and libGibbs, a library for solving the multi-component, multi-phase Gibbs energy minimization problem. libGibbs is built on the external library IpOpt (see below).

TDBread is currently in developer preview, which means that the source code is publicly available but no stable binaries are available for download. For assistance in setting up your build environment and/or collaboration opportunities, please contact the author by e-mail or Bitbucket.
