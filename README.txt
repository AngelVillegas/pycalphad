pycalphad Thermodynamic Suite
=============================

pycalphad is a free and open-source suite of software tools for 
designing thermodynamic models, calculating phase diagrams and 
investigating phase equilibria within the CALPHAD method. It 
provides interfaces to libTDB, a library for reading
Thermo-Calc TDB files, and libgibbs, a library for solving 
the multi-component, multi-phase Gibbs energy minimization 
problem.

The purpose of this project is to provide any interested people
the ability to tinker with and improve the nuts and bolts of 
CALPHAD modeling without having to be a computer scientist or 
expert programmer.

pycalphad is currently in developer preview, which means that 
the source code is publicly available but no stable versions 
are available for download. For assistance in setting up 
your build environment and/or collaboration opportunities, 
please contact the author by e-mail or on GitHub.
